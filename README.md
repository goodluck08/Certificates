# AWS Certified Machine Learning - Speciality

The AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty repository is focused on AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty exam preparation guide.

My experience in passing AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty 2020 Exam in first attempt
I passed AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty certification exam [Dated: May/23/2020]. It was my first attempt and the exam was not  the easy one to be very honest. But all my hard work pays off as i got 881 score and I am so happy to have this certification under my belt.

# Few questions which I have not seen in any training videos/practice papers/AWS training materials/AWS White Papers/AWS Documentation:

Given a Histogram plot and asked what feature engineering needed. 3.INVERSE CONFUSION MATRIX i.e. Predicted values at top and Actual values at side (3-questions referencing Confusion Matrix)
Given a Residual plot and asked about variance and linear learner model performance
Other questions were mostly around below topics:

Quite a lot of questions on choosing right Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms based on given scenario (eg. XGBoost, PCA, ClickStream data analysis, Fraud detection, Anomaly detection etc)
2-4 questions on Use of Docker container to build custom ML algorithms.
8-10 questions on Kinesis services
12-15 questions on combination of AWS services (AWS Glue, S3,Kinesis family, Lambda, Polly, Lex, Transcribe, SageMaker etc)
2-3 questions on ML Security
2-5 questions on using Bag Of Words, N-Gram, Tf-Idf, word embeddings (word2vec),confusion matrix
2-3 questions on document analysis/text analysis
1 question on calculating Model Accuracy
1 question on Poisson distribution

# How I prepared for this exam ?

AWS Training resources:

Exam Readiness: AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty
Introduction to AWS Machine Learning Services
Introduction to Amazon SageMaker
Developing Machine Learning Applications
Machine Learning Security
Consider going through below AWS Training videos if you are new to Data Science(ML and DL):

The Elements of Data Science
ML Building Blocks: Services and Terminology
Machine Learning Terminology and Process
Machine Learning Algorithms Explained
Automatic Model Tuning in Amazon SageMaker
Advanced Analytics with Amazon SageMaker
Highly recommended to read below AWS documentations:

AWS SageMaker (Very Important) AWS Kinesis family AWS Polly, Transcribe, Translate, Comprehend, Lex etc Glancing over AWS services under: Machine Learning, IoT (IoT core, IoT analytics, IoT Greengrass) and Analytics (Athena, Data Pipeline, EMR, Glue, QuickSight, Redshift)

Practice Tests in Udemy and Whizlabs:

I would highly recommend giving below Practice papers in Udemy academy:

1. Udemy: AWS Certified Machine Learningâ€”Specialty 2020 : Full Practice Exam. 
 Also WhizLabs: AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty Practice Tests
